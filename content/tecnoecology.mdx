# Introduction

In todays time we experience and navigate most of the time in abstract spaces, while usually through some kind of graphical user interface associated with the idea of a *profile*. Some platafors are just channels, like whatsapp, email, while others are full platforms of impersonation, more like an mmorpg.

## Ecology

> Ecology is the scientific discipline that studies interactions between individual organisms and their environments, including interactions with both conspecifics and members of other species.

In these abstract spaces we can exist, interact, influence and be influenced by multiple entities, in completely different channels, shapes, dimensions, simultaneously. Several of those entities are single human beings, but most are either abstract constructs or complex systems with intelligent behaviour.

## Tecnology

Tecnology is the result of practical application of knowledge in the world. With tecnology we have deeply modified several aspects of our lives, and recently with computers we are increasingly adding computing power and some degree of intelligent behavior to several of the outcomes of tecnology.

## Tecnoecology
an ecology of tecnological and human entities

Since we started communicating through some kind of external mean other than just our bodies, we have been weaving abstract networks of extended communication. But most of the time our ability through communication was at most a channel, that could speed up but not persist the communication.
Today our abstract existence navigates through highly complex digital spaces as avatars, profiles, massive identities that constantly exchange information with each other and with several other forms of *automatic intelligent behavior*.
