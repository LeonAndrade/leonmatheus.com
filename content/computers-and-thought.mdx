## What is a computer?

I mean we all know what a computer is don't we? It's that thing we use to connect to
the internet, save files, play games and listen to music, but thinking about it, the
computer is not the screen or the sound speakers, it's also not the keyboard neither
any of the individual components attached to the motherboard.

**So, what the heck is a computer?**

Somewhere in the past 10 years something clicked inside me and I began asking myself
that ver quesion. You see, I've always saw myself as someone more oriented towards
liberal arts and humanities, and although I had access to computers and technology
early in my childhood, I never considered technology for outside the lay consumer,
interacting with techlogy only as an end-user with little to no idea of what most of
this things were or how they were possible.
